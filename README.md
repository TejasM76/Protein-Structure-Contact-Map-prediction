# Protein-Structure-Contact-Map-prediction

Protein Contact Prediction with Spark (Closed Competition - ECBDL'14)
This project tackled protein structure prediction using Spark for Big Data in the (now closed) ECBDL'14 Self-deployment track. The goal was to predict residue-residue contacts within proteins, a crucial step in understanding protein folding and function.

Large Dataset: Analyzed 32 million protein instances with 631 features using Spark's distributed processing capabilities.
Imbalanced Classes: Handled the highly imbalanced data (98% negative examples) to accurately predict both contacting and non-contacting residues.
