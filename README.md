# 🧬 Protein Structure Contact Map Prediction (Big Data)

A bioinformatics engineering project that explores the application of Apache Spark for large-scale protein structure prediction. By implementing parallel processing techniques and a MapReduce paradigm, this project drastically reduces the computational time required to predict complex protein contact maps.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Distributed Computing (Apache Spark):** Utilizes RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) to handle massive genomic datasets.
- **Divide and Conquer Architecture:** Breaks down complex protein folding predictions into parallelizable tasks.
- **Ensemble Machine Learning:** Aggregates multiple predictive models to achieve higher accuracy on biological structures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python / Jupyter Notebooks
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Bioinformatics Data Parsing
